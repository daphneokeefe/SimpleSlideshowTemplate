=======================

Template HTML and CSS files for a simple text slideshow

I often find that PowerPoint and other slideshow-making presentation tools provide much more functionality, much larger files, and a proprietary lock-in that I don't want or need.

So, I create simple HTML files for my presentations.

The design:
1) Horizontal navigation across the top is created with an all-white ul-li whose links appear in pale grey on hover.
2) One iframe to display the slide .html pages.
3) Next and Previous links in the bottom corners of the slides, for additional navigation.
4) One .css stylesheet handles it all.
5) One JavaScript function on the outer page (home.html) populates the iframe with the page indicated in the clicked link.
